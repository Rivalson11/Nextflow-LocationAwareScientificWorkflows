## **Description:**

This repository entails the design and implementation of a location aware nextflow process. The location_aware folder includes all the nextflow libraries used in order best determine which excutor any workflow should use in order to optimize performance. A workflow system can let independent jobs run on different computers and environments. There is extensive work with containerisation, in order to determine if it is more effective to transmit the data to the computers where the code is executed (effectiveness will be dependant on network constraints) or rather transfer the computation to where the data resides.

## **Development:**

Coding is to be done with Nextflow.

***Exuctional choices still to be determind***

## **Summary:**

## **Testing Results:**

Tabulation of executional time results comparing using this location aware process within other workflows vs not
